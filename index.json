Although I hope that my ramblings are helpful for others, I have to admit that my motivations to do so are selfish:\n you truly master a new concept when you are able to explain it succinctly in your own words I have enjoyed reading over 85 papers in the last 2 years but lack an easy way to revisit my summary learnings from these efforts It's time to practise my English writing skills a bit  Now that you know why I am adding more online content let's spend a minute to talk about what I intend to write about. The short answer is \u0026ldquo;anything that I studied recently in my professional sphere of interest\u0026rdquo;. This starts from computer vision and may zoom in a lot on medical image analysis but I sometimes wander into methodology concepts that I fancy (e.g. Variational Auto-Encoders and causal inference to name two of my current favorites).\nNext, let's talk briefly about my sources. Most of my study material are scientific papers published on arXiv/journals and papers or talks in conferences (e.g. MICCAI, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, \u0026hellip;) or in readings groups that I regularly attend. You may ask how much I read and spend time studying new concepts, well much less than I would like but I try carving out a few hours per week in my schedule. I have tried following a \u0026lsquo;read two new papers every week\u0026rsquo; routine for a while, but I have abandonned this by now. I currently follow my intuition browsing through the citation notifications that end up in my mailbox and diving into some when I am able to free up some time. More importantly, I decided to increase the depth of my readings and spend more time thinking about what I have read (favoring depth over breadth).\nFinally, I would like to ask you, the reader, a favour. Please reach out to me for questions or comments on my content. I am specifically keen to find out whether my writings are clear and discuss your views or experiments with the discussed content. Although this format is static and one-way, I would love to start a conversation with anyone interested!!\n","date":1627061872,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627061872,"objectID":"42271cb50ed5bafba9b6817178997a95","permalink":"https://gourie.github.io/post/starter/","publishdate":"2021-07-23T19:37:52+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/starter/","section":"post","summary":"During my long summer break I decided to start writing about my learnings on this website.

Vertebral compression fractures are early signs of the disease and considered risk predictors for secondary osteoporotic fractures. We present a detection method to opportunistically screen spine-containing CT images for the presence of these vertebral fractures. Inspired by radiology practice, existing methods are based on 2D and 2.5 D features but we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first method for detecting vertebral fractures in CT using automatically learned 3D feature maps. The presented method explicitly localizes these fractures allowing radiologists to interpret its results. We train a voxel-classification 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a training database of 90 cases that has been semi-automatically generated using radiologist readings that are readily available in clinical practice. Our 3D method produces an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 95% for patient-level fracture detection and an AUC of 93% for vertebra-level fracture detection in a five-fold cross-validation experiment.","tags":null,"title":"Detection of vertebral fractures in CT using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Note: the video requires an RSNA virtual meeting subscription\n","date":1575223500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575223500,"objectID":"344f6089ae47bf86e6002db6920dbb79","permalink":"https://gourie.github.io/talk/rsna2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T11:05:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/rsna2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Presenting results of first prototype study on 90 CT images to radiology community.","tags":[],"title":"Automated Detection of Vertebral Fractures in CT Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571283000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571283000,"objectID":"bdddfe67531944aa19ac3a6c807f056b","permalink":"https://gourie.github.io/talk/miccai_csi2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-17T09:30:00+06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/miccai_csi2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Presenting results of first prototype study on 90 CT images to fellow computer scientist researchers.","tags":[],"title":"Detection of vertebral fractures in CT using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521042300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521042300,"objectID":"89576a767cc531fc592995f0df6b1061","permalink":"https://gourie.github.io/talk/mitclub_march2018/","publishdate":"2018-02-22T09:45:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/mitclub_march2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Basic intuitions behind deep learning, building AI products requires multidisciplinary expertise","tags":[],"title":"Medical analytics and ethics","type":"talk"}]
