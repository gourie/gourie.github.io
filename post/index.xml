      <title>Time to start writing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my long summer break I decided to start writing about my learnings on this website. Although I hope that my ramblings
are helpful for others, I have to admit that my motivations to do so are selfish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you truly master a new concept when you are able to explain it succinctly in your own words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have enjoyed reading over 85 papers in the last 2 years but lack an easy way to revisit my summary learnings
from these efforts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s time to practise my English writing skills a bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you know &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; I am adding more online content let&#39;s spend a minute to talk about &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; I intend to write about.
The short answer is &amp;ldquo;anything that I studied recently in my professional sphere of interest&amp;rdquo;. This starts from computer
vision and may zoom in a lot on medical image analysis but I sometimes wander into methodology concepts that I fancy (e.g.
Variational Auto-Encoders and causal inference to name two of my current favorites).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, let&#39;s talk briefly about my sources. Most of my study material are scientific papers published on arXiv/journals and
papers or talks in conferences (e.g. MICCAI, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, &amp;hellip;) or in readings groups that I regularly attend.
You may ask how much I read and spend time studying new concepts, well much less than I would like but I try carving out
a few hours per week in my schedule.
I have tried following a &amp;lsquo;read two new papers every week&amp;rsquo; routine for a while, but I have abandonned this by now. I
currently follow my intuition browsing through the citation notifications that end up in my mailbox and diving into
some when I am able to free up some time. More importantly, I decided to increase the depth of my readings and spend
more time thinking about what I have read (favoring depth over breadth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would like to ask you, the reader, a favour. Please reach out to me for questions or comments on my content.
I am specifically keen to find out whether my writings are clear and discuss your views or experiments with the discussed
content. Although this format is static and one-way, I would love to start a conversation with anyone interested!!&lt;/p&gt;
